# Future Scope

## 🎯 Personalized Booking Segmentation

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We plan to implement more advanced segmentation for booking preferences. This would allow the system to automatically identify user preferences based on previous bookings and suggest personalized itineraries, accommodation, or transport options. By accurately segmenting user choices, the system can offer a more tailored experience, enhancing visitor satisfaction and efficiency.
</div>

## 🚀 Advanced AI Techniques

<div style="text-align: justify;">
We aim to integrate advanced AI techniques such as reinforcement learning and predictive modeling to further refine recommendations and user interaction. These techniques will enable the system to adapt to user behavior in real-time, improving the accuracy of bookings, suggestions, and the overall user experience. The system will become more intuitive and responsive as it learns from each interaction.
</div>

## 🧠 Expanding Multilingual and Regional Support

<div style="text-align: justify;">
PRAGYA AI will expand its language capabilities, incorporating more regional languages and dialects. This will break down further barriers for diverse users, allowing them to interact seamlessly in their preferred language. Enhanced localization will make the system accessible to users in remote areas, broadening its reach across global markets.
</div>

## 📱 Deeper Integration with WhatsApp and Other Platforms

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Our future goal includes expanding beyond WhatsApp, integrating PRAGYA AI with more social and communication platforms like Telegram or Messenger. This will ensure users can access services via their preferred channels, further enhancing convenience and accessibility, especially for those unfamiliar with web-based systems.
</div>

## 📊 Large Dataset Collection

<div style="text-align: justify;">
we will invest in collection and preparation of a larger dataset of various tourist attractions. We can collaborate and/or partner with various private museums, art galleries, etc to offer users a wider range of leisure places.
